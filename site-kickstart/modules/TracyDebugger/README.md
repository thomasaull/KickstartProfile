### About Tracy

Tracy library is a useful helper for everyday PHP programmers. It helps you to:

* quickly detect and correct errors with an expandable call stack tree
* log errors (and optionally receive emails when an error occurs in production mode)
* dump variables
* measure execution time of scripts/queries
* see memory consumption between breakpoints

### Module features

Includes config settings for a variety of Tracy options.

Many optional custom panels provide a wide variety of information and tools to help your development and debugging process. See the blog post for more details.

Additionally, content can be dumped to the page via TD::dump() or to the debug bar via TD::barDump(),
or logged via TD::log() from PW template files. eg.

```
TD::debugAll($page, 'Current Page');
   Aliases;  debugAll(), da()

TD::barDump($page, 'Current Page');
   Aliases;  barDump(), bd()

TD::dump($page);
   Aliases; dump(), d()

TD::log('Log Message');
    Alias; l()

TD::fireLog('Log Message');
    Alias; fireLog(), fl()

TD::addBreakpoint('Name');
    Alias; addBreakpoint(), bp()

TD::timer();
    Aliases; timer(), t()
```

By default, manually logged content is sent to: /site/assets/logs/tracy/info.log,
but you can specify an optional second parameter to one of the following:
'debug', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'exception', 'critical' files.

eg. `TD::log('Log Message', 'debug');` which will put the message in the debug.log file.


#### FireLog

To make fireLog work, you need to add some browser extensions:
