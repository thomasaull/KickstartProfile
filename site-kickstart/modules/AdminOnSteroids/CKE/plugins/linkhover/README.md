# Link Hover

A plugin for CKEditor. Shows the `href` attribute of a link in a tooltip when the link is hovered. This saves you from having to open the link dialog in order to check where a link points to.

## Installation

This readme assumes installation in ProcessWire CMS.

The plugin folder must be named "linkhover" â€“ if necessary, rename the folder to remove the "-master" suffix added by GitHub. Copy the "linkhover" folder to /site/modules/InputfieldCKEditor/plugins/

In the field settings for each CKEditor field that you want to activate the plugin for, check the "linkhover" checkbox at Input > Plugins > Extra Plugins
